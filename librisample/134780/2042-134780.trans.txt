2042-134780-0000 HE HAD NOT LEARNED TO READ IN HIS CHILDHOOD
2042-134780-0001 HIS FATHER WAS CALLED JEAN VALJEAN OR VLAJEAN PROBABLY A SOBRIQUET
2042-134780-0002 JEAN VALJEAN WAS OF THAT THOUGHTFUL BUT NOT GLOOMY DISPOSITION WHICH CONSTITUTES THE PECULIARITY OF AFFECTIONATE NATURES ON THE WHOLE HOWEVER
2042-134780-0003 HE HAD LOST HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AT A VERY EARLY AGE HIS MOTHER HAD DIED OF A MILK FEVER WHICH HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY ATTENDED TO HIS FATHER A TREE PRUNER LIKE HIMSELF HAD BEEN KILLED BY A FALL FROM A TREE
2042-134780-0004 WAS A SISTER OLDER THAN HIMSELF A WIDOW WITH SEVEN CHILDREN BOYS AND GIRLS THIS SISTER HAD BROUGHT UP JEAN VALJEAN AND SO LONG AS SHE HAD A HUSBAND SHE LODGED AND FED HER YOUNG BROTHER THE HUSBAND DIED
2042-134780-0005 THE ELDEST OF THE SEVEN CHILDREN WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD THE YOUNGEST ONE JEAN VALJEAN HAD JUST ATTAINED HIS TWENTY FIFTH YEAR HE TOOK THE FATHER'S PLACE AND IN HIS TURN SUPPORTED THE SISTER WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP
2042-134780-0006 THIS WAS DONE SIMPLY AS A DUTY AND EVEN A LITTLE CHURLISHLY ON THE PART OF JEAN VALJEAN THUS HIS YOUTH HAD BEEN SPENT IN RUDE AND ILL PAID TOIL HE HAD NEVER KNOWN A KIND WOMAN FRIEND IN HIS NATIVE PARTS
2042-134780-0007 HE HAD NOT HAD THE TIME TO FALL IN LOVE HE RETURNED AT NIGHT WEARY AND ATE HIS BROTH WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD HIS SISTER MOTHER JEANNE OFTEN TOOK THE BEST PART OF HIS REPAST FROM HIS BOWL WHILE HE WAS EATING
2042-134780-0008 A BIT OF MEAT A SLICE OF BACON THE HEART OF THE CABBAGE TO GIVE TO ONE OF HER CHILDREN AS HE WENT ON EATING WITH HIS HEAD BENT OVER THE TABLE AND ALMOST INTO HIS SOUP HIS LONG HAIR FALLING ABOUT HIS BOWL AND CONCEALING HIS EYES
2042-134780-0009 HE HAD THE AIR OF PERCEIVING NOTHING AND ALLOWING IT
2042-134780-0010 A FARMER'S WIFE NAMED MARIE CLAUDE THE VALJEAN CHILDREN HABITUALLY FAMISHED SOMETIMES WENT TO BORROW FROM MARIE CLAUDE A PINT OF MILK IN THEIR MOTHER'S NAME WHICH THEY DRANK BEHIND A HEDGE OR IN SOME ALLEY CORNER SNATCHING THE JUG FROM EACH OTHER SO HASTILY
2042-134780-0011 THAT THE LITTLE GIRLS SPILLED IT ON THEIR APRONS AND DOWN THEIR NECKS IF THEIR MOTHER HAD KNOWN OF THIS MARAUDING SHE WOULD HAVE PUNISHED THE DELINQUENTS SEVERELY JEAN VALJEAN GRUFFLY AND GRUMBLINGLY PAID MARIE CLAUDE FOR THE PINT OF MILK BEHIND THEIR MOTHER'S BACK
2042-134780-0012 AND THE CHILDREN WERE NOT PUNISHED IN PRUNING SEASON HE EARNED EIGHTEEN SOUS A DAY THEN HE HIRED OUT AS A HAY MAKER AS LABORER AS NEAT HERD ON A FARM AS A DRUDGE HE DID WHATEVER HE COULD
2042-134780-0013 HIS SISTER WORKED ALSO BUT WHAT COULD SHE DO WITH SEVEN LITTLE CHILDREN IT WAS A SAD GROUP ENVELOPED IN MISERY WHICH WAS BEING GRADUALLY ANNIHILATED A VERY HARD WINTER CAME JEAN HAD NO WORK
2042-134780-0014 THE FAMILY HAD NO BREAD NO BREAD LITERALLY SEVEN CHILDREN
2042-134780-0015 WAS PREPARING TO GO TO BED WHEN HE HEARD A VIOLENT BLOW ON THE GRATED FRONT OF HIS SHOP HE ARRIVED IN TIME TO SEE AN ARM PASSED THROUGH A HOLE MADE BY A BLOW FROM A FIST THROUGH THE GRATING AND THE GLASS
2042-134780-0016 THE ARM SEIZED A LOAF OF BREAD AND CARRIED IT OFF ISABEAU RAN OUT IN HASTE THE ROBBER FLED AT THE FULL SPEED OF HIS LEGS ISABEAU RAN AFTER HIM AND STOPPED HIM THE THIEF HAD FLUNG AWAY THE LOAF BUT HIS ARM WAS STILL BLEEDING
2042-134780-0017 IT WAS JEAN VALJEAN THIS TOOK PLACE IN SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE
2042-134780-0018 HE HAD A GUN WHICH HE USED BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE IN THE WORLD HE WAS A BIT OF A POACHER AND THIS INJURED HIS CASE THERE EXISTS A LEGITIMATE PREJUDICE AGAINST POACHERS THE POACHER LIKE THE SMUGGLER SMACKS TOO STRONGLY OF THE BRIGAND
2042-134780-0019 NEVERTHELESS WE WILL REMARK CURSORILY THERE IS STILL AN ABYSS BETWEEN THESE RACES OF MEN AND THE HIDEOUS ASSASSIN OF THE TOWNS THE POACHER LIVES IN THE FOREST THE SMUGGLER LIVES IN THE MOUNTAINS OR ON THE SEA
2042-134780-0020 THE CITIES MAKE FEROCIOUS MEN BECAUSE THEY MAKE CORRUPT MEN THE MOUNTAIN THE SEA THE FOREST MAKE SAVAGE MEN THEY DEVELOP THE FIERCE SIDE BUT OFTEN WITHOUT DESTROYING THE HUMANE SIDE
2042-134780-0021 JEAN VALJEAN WAS PRONOUNCED GUILTY THE TERMS OF THE CODE WERE EXPLICIT THERE OCCUR FORMIDABLE HOURS IN OUR CIVILIZATION THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN THE PENAL LAWS DECREE A SHIPWRECK
2042-134780-0022 WHAT AN OMINOUS MINUTE IS THAT IN WHICH SOCIETY DRAWS BACK AND CONSUMMATES THE IRREPARABLE ABANDONMENT OF A SENTIENT BEING
2042-134780-0023 THE VICTORY OF MONTENOTTE WON BY THE GENERAL IN CHIEF OF THE ARMY OF ITALY WHOM THE MESSAGE OF THE DIRECTORY TO THE FIVE HUNDRED
2042-134780-0024 WAS ANNOUNCED IN PARIS ON THAT SAME DAY A GREAT GANG OF GALLEY SLAVES WAS PUT IN CHAINS AT BICETRE JEAN VALJEAN FORMED A PART OF THAT GANG AN OLD TURNKEY OF THE PRISON WHO IS NOW NEARLY EIGHTY YEARS OLD
2042-134780-0025 STILL RECALLS PERFECTLY THAT UNFORTUNATE WRETCH WHO WAS CHAINED TO THE END OF THE FOURTH LINE IN THE NORTH ANGLE OF THE COURTYARD HE WAS SEATED ON THE GROUND LIKE THE OTHERS HE DID NOT SEEM TO COMPREHEND HIS POSITION EXCEPT THAT IT WAS HORRIBLE
2042-134780-0026 IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE ALSO WAS DISENTANGLING FROM AMID THE VAGUE IDEAS OF A POOR MAN IGNORANT OF EVERYTHING SOMETHING EXCESSIVE WHILE THE BOLT OF HIS IRON COLLAR WAS BEING RIVETED BEHIND HIS HEAD WITH HEAVY BLOWS FROM THE HAMMER
2042-134780-0027 HE WEPT HIS TEARS STIFLED HIM THEY IMPEDED HIS SPEECH HE ONLY MANAGED TO SAY FROM TIME TO TIME
2042-134780-0028 THEN STILL SOBBING HE RAISED HIS RIGHT HAND AND LOWERED IT GRADUALLY SEVEN TIMES AS THOUGH HE WERE TOUCHING IN SUCCESSION SEVEN HEADS OF UNEQUAL HEIGHTS
2042-134780-0029 HE SET OUT FOR TOULON HE ARRIVED THERE AFTER A JOURNEY OF TWENTY SEVEN DAYS ON A CART WITH A CHAIN ON HIS NECK AT TOULON HE WAS CLOTHED IN THE RED CASSOCK ALL THAT HAD CONSTITUTED HIS LIFE EVEN TO HIS NAME WAS EFFACED
2042-134780-0030 HE WAS NO LONGER EVEN JEAN VALJEAN HE WAS NUMBER TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED ONE WHAT BECAME OF HIS SISTER WHAT BECAME OF THE SEVEN CHILDREN WHO TROUBLED HIMSELF ABOUT THAT
2042-134780-0031 WHAT BECOMES OF THE HANDFUL OF LEAVES FROM THE YOUNG TREE WHICH IS SAWED OFF AT THE ROOT IT IS ALWAYS THE SAME STORY THESE POOR LIVING BEINGS THESE CREATURES OF GOD HENCEFORTH WITHOUT SUPPORT WITHOUT GUIDE WITHOUT REFUGE
2042-134780-0032 WANDERED AWAY AT RANDOM WHO EVEN KNOWS EACH IN HIS OWN DIRECTION PERHAPS AND LITTLE BY LITTLE BURIED THEMSELVES IN THAT COLD MIST WHICH ENGULFS SOLITARY DESTINIES GLOOMY SHADES INTO WHICH DISAPPEAR IN SUCCESSION SO MANY UNLUCKY HEADS
2042-134780-0033 IN THE SOMBRE MARCH OF THE HUMAN RACE THEY QUITTED THE COUNTRY THE CLOCK TOWER OF WHAT HAD BEEN THEIR VILLAGE FORGOT THEM THE BOUNDARY LINE OF WHAT HAD BEEN THEIR FIELD FORGOT THEM AFTER A FEW YEARS RESIDENCE IN THE GALLEYS
2042-134780-0034 IN THAT HEART WHERE THERE HAD BEEN A WOUND THERE WAS A SCAR THAT IS ALL ONLY ONCE DURING ALL THE TIME WHICH HE SPENT AT TOULON DID HE HEAR HIS SISTER MENTIONED THIS HAPPENED I THINK TOWARDS THE END OF THE FOURTH YEAR OF HIS CAPTIVITY
2042-134780-0035 I KNOW NOT THROUGH WHAT CHANNELS THE NEWS REACHED HIM SOME ONE WHO HAD KNOWN THEM IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY HAD SEEN HIS SISTER SHE WAS IN PARIS
2042-134780-0036 SHE HAD WITH HER ONLY ONE CHILD A LITTLE BOY THE YOUNGEST WHERE WERE THE OTHER SIX PERHAPS SHE DID NOT KNOW HERSELF EVERY MORNING SHE WENT TO A PRINTING OFFICE

2042-134780-0039 THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW THE CHILD TO COME INTO THE PRINTING OFFICE BECAUSE HE WAS IN THE WAY THEY SAID WHEN THE WORKMEN PASSED IN THE MORNING THEY BEHELD THIS POOR LITTLE BEING SEATED ON THE PAVEMENT OVERCOME WITH DROWSINESS AND OFTEN FAST ASLEEP IN THE SHADOW
2042-134780-0040 CROUCHED DOWN AND DOUBLED UP OVER HIS BASKET WHEN IT RAINED AN OLD WOMAN THE PORTRESS TOOK PITY ON HIM SHE TOOK HIM INTO HER DEN WHERE THERE WAS A PALLET A SPINNING WHEEL AND TWO WOODEN CHAIRS AND THE LITTLE ONE SLUMBERED IN A CORNER
2042-134780-0041 PRESSING HIMSELF CLOSE TO THE CAT THAT HE MIGHT SUFFER LESS FROM COLD AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THE SCHOOL OPENED AND HE ENTERED THAT IS WHAT WAS TOLD TO JEAN VALJEAN THEY TALKED TO HIM ABOUT IT FOR ONE DAY IT WAS A MOMENT
2042-134780-0042 A FLASH AS THOUGH A WINDOW HAD SUDDENLY BEEN OPENED UPON THE DESTINY OF THOSE THINGS WHOM HE HAD LOVED THEN ALL CLOSED AGAIN HE HEARD NOTHING MORE FOREVER NOTHING FROM THEM EVER REACHED HIM AGAIN HE NEVER BEHELD THEM
2042-134780-0043 HE NEVER MET THEM AGAIN AND IN THE CONTINUATION OF THIS MOURNFUL HISTORY THEY WILL NOT BE MET WITH ANY MORE TOWARDS THE END OF THIS FOURTH YEAR JEAN VALJEAN'S TURN TO ESCAPE ARRIVED
2042-134780-0044 HIS COMRADES ASSISTED HIM AS IS THE CUSTOM IN THAT SAD PLACE HE ESCAPED HE WANDERED FOR TWO DAYS IN THE FIELDS AT LIBERTY IF BEING AT LIBERTY IS TO BE HUNTED TO TURN THE HEAD EVERY INSTANT TO QUAKE AT THE SLIGHTEST NOISE TO BE AFRAID OF EVERYTHING
2042-134780-0045 OF A SMOKING ROOF OF A PASSING MAN OF A BARKING DOG OF A GALLOPING HORSE OF A STRIKING CLOCK OF THE DAY BECAUSE ONE CAN SEE OF THE NIGHT BECAUSE ONE CANNOT SEE OF THE HIGHWAY OF THE PATH OF A BUSH OF SLEEP
