had not learned to read in his childhood
father was called jean valjean or vlajean probably a sobriquet
valjean was of that thoughtful but not gloomy disposition which constitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures on the whole however
had lost his father and mother at a very early age his mother had died of a milk fever which had not been properly attended to his father a tree pruner like himself had been killed by a fall from a tree
a sister older than himself a widow with seven children boys and girls this sister had brought up jean valjean and so long as she had a husband she lodged and fed her young brother the husband died
eldest of the seven children was eight years old the youngest one jean valjean had just attained his twenty fifth year he took the father's place and in his turn supported the sister who had brought him up
was done simply as a duty and even a little churlishly on the part of jean valjean thus his youth had been spent in rude and ill paid toil he had never known a kind woman friend in his native parts
had not had the time to fall in love he returned at night weary and ate his broth without uttering a word his sister mother jeanne often took the best part of his repast from his bowl while he was eating
bit of meat a slice of bacon the heart of the cabbage to give to one of her children as he went on eating with his head bent over the table and almost into his soup his long hair falling about his bowl and concealing his eyes
had the air of perceiving nothing and allowing it
farmer's wife named marie claude the valjean children habitually famished sometimes went to borrow from marie claude a pint of milk in their mother's name which they drank behind a hedge or in some alley corner snatching the jug from each other so hastily
the little girls spilled it on their aprons and down their necks if their mother had known of this marauding she would have punished the delinquents severely jean valjean gruffly and grumblingly paid marie claude for the pint of milk behind their mother's back
the children were not punished in pruning season he earned eighteen sous a day then he hired out as a hay maker as laborer as neat herd on a farm as a drudge he did whatever he could
sister worked also but what could she do with seven little children it was a sad group enveloped in misery which was being gradually annihilated a very hard winter came jean had no work
family had no bread no bread literally seven children
preparing to go to bed when he heard a violent blow on the grated front of his shop he arrived in time to see an arm passed through a hole made by a blow from a fist through the grating and the glass
arm seized a loaf of bread and carried it off isabeau ran out in haste the robber fled at the full speed of his legs isabeau ran after him and stopped him the thief had flung away the loaf but his arm was still bleeding
was jean valjean this took place in seventeen ninety five
had a gun which he used better than any one else in the world he was a bit of a poacher and this injured his case there exists a legitimate prejudice against poachers the poacher like the smuggler smacks too strongly of the brigand
we will remark cursorily there is still an abyss between these races of men and the hideous assassin of the towns the poacher lives in the forest the smuggler lives in the mountains or on the sea
cities make ferocious men because they make corrupt men the mountain the sea the forest make savage men they develop the fierce side but often without destroying the humane side
valjean was pronounced guilty the terms of the code were explicit there occur formidable hours in our civilization there are moments when the penal laws decree a shipwreck
an ominous minute is that in which society draws back and consummates the irreparable abandonment of a sentient being
victory of montenotte won by the general in chief of the army of italy whom the message of the directory to the five hundred
announced in paris on that same day a great gang of galley slaves was put in chains at bicetre jean valjean formed a part of that gang an old turnkey of the prison who is now nearly eighty years old
recalls perfectly that unfortunate wretch who was chained to the end of the fourth line in the north angle of the courtyard he was seated on the ground like the others he did not seem to comprehend his position except that it was horrible
is probable that he also was disentangling from amid the vague ideas of a poor man ignorant of everything something excessive while the bolt of his iron collar was being riveted behind his head with heavy blows from the hammer
wept his tears stifled him they impeded his speech he only managed to say from time to time
still sobbing he raised his right hand and lowered it gradually seven times as though he were touching in succession seven heads of unequal heights
set out for toulon he arrived there after a journey of twenty seven days on a cart with a chain on his neck at toulon he was clothed in the red cassock all that had constituted his life even to his name was effaced
was no longer even jean valjean he was number twenty four thousand six hundred one what became of his sister what became of the seven children who troubled himself about that
becomes of the handful of leaves from the young tree which is sawed off at the root it is always the same story these poor living beings these creatures of god henceforth without support without guide without refuge
away at random who even knows each in his own direction perhaps and little by little buried themselves in that cold mist which engulfs solitary destinies gloomy shades into which disappear in succession so many unlucky heads
the sombre march of the human race they quitted the country the clock tower of what had been their village forgot them the boundary line of what had been their field forgot them after a few years residence in the galleys
that heart where there had been a wound there was a scar that is all only once during all the time which he spent at toulon did he hear his sister mentioned this happened i think towards the end of the fourth year of his captivity
know not through what channels the news reached him some one who had known them in their own country had seen his sister she was in paris
had with her only one child a little boy the youngest where were the other six perhaps she did not know herself every morning she went to a printing office
she was a folder and stitcher she was obliged to be there at six o'clock in the morning long before daylight in winter in the same building with the printing office there was a school and to this school she took her little boy
was seven years old but as she entered the printing office at six and the school only opened at seven the child had to wait in the courtyard for the school to open for an hour one hour of a winter night in the open air
would not allow the child to come into the printing office because he was in the way they said when the workmen passed in the morning they beheld this poor little being seated on the pavement overcome with drowsiness and often fast asleep in the shadow
down and doubled up over his basket when it rained an old woman the portress took pity on him she took him into her den where there was a pallet a spinning wheel and two wooden chairs and the little one slumbered in a corner
himself close to the cat that he might suffer less from cold at seven o'clock the school opened and he entered that is what was told to jean valjean they talked to him about it for one day it was a moment
flash as though a window had suddenly been opened upon the destiny of those things whom he had loved then all closed again he heard nothing more forever nothing from them ever reached him again he never beheld them
never met them again and in the continuation of this mournful history they will not be met with any more towards the end of this fourth year jean valjean's turn to escape arrived
comrades assisted him as is the custom in that sad place he escaped he wandered for two days in the fields at liberty if being at liberty is to be hunted to turn the head every instant to quake at the slightest noise to be afraid of everything
a smoking roof of a passing man of a barking dog of a galloping horse of a striking clock of the day because one can see of the night because one cannot see of the highway of the path of a bush of sleep
had neither eaten nor slept for thirty six hours the maritime tribunal condemned him for this crime to a prolongation of his term for three years which made eight years
the sixth year his turn to escape occurred again he availed himself of it but could not accomplish his flight fully he was missing at roll call the cannon were fired
at night the patrol found him hidden under the keel of a vessel in process of construction he resisted the galley guards who seized him escape and rebellion this case provided for by a special code
punished by an addition of five years two of them in the double chain thirteen years in the tenth year his turn came round again he again profited by it he succeeded no better
years for this fresh attempt sixteen years finally i think it was during his thirteenth year he made a last attempt and only succeeded in getting retaken at the end of four hours of absence
years for those four hours nineteen years in october eighteen fifteen he was released he had entered there in seventeen ninety six for having broken a pane of glass
taken a loaf of bread room for a brief parenthesis this is the second time during his studies on the penal question and damnation by law that the author of this book has come across the theft of a loaf of bread
the point of departure for the disaster of a destiny claude gueux had stolen a loaf jean valjean had stolen a loaf english statistics prove the fact that four thefts out of five in london
hunger for their immediate cause jean valjean had entered the galleys sobbing and shuddering he emerged impassive
we hope will be very attentively perused by young people of both sexes partridge had no sooner left mister jones than mister nightingale with whom he had now contracted a great intimacy came to him
after a short salutation said so tom i hear you had company very late last night upon my soul you are a happy fellow
can keep chairs waiting at your door till two in the morning he then ran on with much commonplace raillery of the same kind till jones at last interrupted him saying i suppose you have received all this information from missus miller
hath been up here a little while ago to give me warning the good woman is afraid it seems of the reputation of her daughters oh she is wonderfully nice says nightingale upon that account
you remember she would not let nancy go with us to the masquerade nay upon my honour i think she's in the right of it says jones however i have taken her at her word and have sent partridge to look for another lodging if you will says nightingale
may i believe be again together for to tell you a secret which i desire you won't mention in the family i intend to quit the house to day what hath missus miller given you warning too my friend cries jones no answered the other
i am going to pall mall and do you intend to make a secret of your going away said jones i promise you answered nightingale i don't intend to bilk my lodgings but i have a private reason for not taking a formal leave
so private answered jones
will be some wet eyes on your departure poor nancy i pity her faith indeed jack you have played the fool with that girl you have given her a longing which i am afraid nothing will ever cure her of
answered what the devil would you have me do
answered jones i would not have had you make love to her as you have often done in my presence i have been astonished at the blindness of her mother in never seeing it
you have made her daughter distractedly in love with you the poor girl cannot conceal it a moment her eyes are never off from you and she always colours every time you come into the room indeed i pity her heartily
jack said jones you wilfully misunderstand me
do not suppose so ill of you nay i will go farther i do not imagine you have laid a regular premeditated scheme for the destruction of the quiet of a poor little creature or have even foreseen the consequence
i am sure thou art a very good natured fellow and such a one can never be guilty of a cruelty of that kind but at the same time you have pleased your own vanity without considering that this poor girl was made a sacrifice to it
while you have had no design but of amusing an idle hour you have actually given her reason to flatter herself that you had the most serious designs in her favour prithee jack answer me honestly
what have tended all those elegant and luscious descriptions of happiness arising from violent and mutual fondness all those warm professions of tenderness and generous disinterested love did you imagine she would not apply them
speak ingenuously
my soul tom cries nightingale
wilt make an admirable parson so i suppose you would not go to bed to nancy now if she would let you no cries jones
tom answered nightingale last night remember last night when every eye was closed and the pale moon and silent stars shone conscious of the theft lookee mister nightingale said jones
am no canting hypocrite nor do i pretend to the gift of chastity more than my neighbours i have been guilty with women i own it
would i to procure pleasure to myself be knowingly the cause of misery to any human being well well said nightingale i believe you and i am convinced you acquit me of any such thing
do from my heart answered jones of having debauched the girl but not from having gained her affections if i have said nightingale i am sorry for it
time and absence will soon wear off such impressions it is a receipt i must take myself for to confess the truth to you i never liked any girl half so much in my whole life but i must let you into the whole secret tom
father hath provided a match for me with a woman i never saw and she is now coming to town in order for me to make my addresses to her at these words jones burst into a loud fit of laughter
jones jones i wish i had a fortune in my own possession i heartily wish you had cries jones for if this be the case i sincerely pity you both but surely you don't intend to go away without taking your leave of her
would not answered nightingale undergo the pain of taking leave for ten thousand pounds besides i am convinced instead of answering any good purpose it would only serve to inflame my poor nancy the more
in the evening or to morrow morning i intend to depart jones promised he would not and said upon reflection he thought as he had determined and was obliged to leave her he took the most prudent method
then told nightingale he should be very glad to lodge in the same house with him and it was accordingly agreed between them that nightingale should procure him either the ground floor
the young gentleman himself was to occupy that which was between them this nightingale of whom we shall be presently obliged to say a little more was in the ordinary transactions of life a man of strict honour
what is more rare among young gentlemen of the town one of strict honesty too yet in affairs of love he was somewhat loose in his morals not that he was even here as void of principle as gentlemen sometimes are
oftener affect to be but it is certain he had been guilty of some indefensible treachery to women and had in a certain mystery called making love practised many deceits which if he had used in trade
as the world i know not well for what reason agree to see this treachery in a better light he was so far from being ashamed of his iniquities of this kind that he gloried in them
would often boast of his skill in gaining of women and his triumphs over their hearts for which he had before this time received some rebukes from jones who always exprest great bitterness against any misbehaviour to the fair part of the species
if considered he said as they ought to be in the light of the dearest friends were to be cultivated honoured and caressed with the utmost love and tenderness but if regarded as enemies
to value himself upon it chapter five a short account of the history of missus miller jones this day eat a pretty good dinner for a sick man
is to say the larger half of a shoulder of mutton
that good woman having learnt either by means of partridge or by some other means natural or supernatural that he had a connexion with mister allworthy could not endure the thoughts of parting with him in an angry manner jones accepted the invitation
the girls sent out of the room than the widow without much preface began as follows well there are very surprizing things happen in this world but certainly it is a wonderful business that i should have a relation of mister allworthy in my house
sir you little imagine what a friend that best of gentlemen hath been to me and mine yes sir i am not ashamed to own it it is owing to his goodness that i did not long since perish for want and leave my poor little wretches two destitute
friendless orphans to the care or rather to the cruelty of the world you must know sir though i am now reduced to get my living by letting lodgings i was born and bred a gentlewoman my father was an officer of the army
died in a considerable rank but he lived up to his pay and as that expired with him his family at his death became beggars we were three sisters one of us had the good luck to die soon after of the small pox
having inherited a vast fortune from her father which he had got by pawnbroking was married to a gentleman of great estate and fashion she used my sister so barbarously often upbraiding her with her birth and poverty
her in derision a gentlewoman that i believe she at length broke the heart of the poor girl in short she likewise died within a twelvemonth after my father fortune thought proper to provide better for me
within a month from his decease i was married to a clergyman
a celebrated wrestler was there who had killed many men in contests of this kind orlando the young man he was to wrestle with was so slender and youthful that rosalind and celia thought he would surely be killed
others had been so they spoke to him and asked him not to attempt so dangerous an adventure but the only effect of their words was to make him wish more to come off well in the encounter so as to win praise from such sweet ladies
like rosalind's father was being kept out of his inheritance by his brother and was so sad at his brother's unkindness that
did not care much whether he lived or died but now the sight of the fair rosalind gave him strength and courage so that he did marvelously and at last threw charles to such a tune that the wrestler had to be carried off the ground
frederick was pleased with his courage and asked his name my name is orlando and i am the youngest son of sir rowland de boys said the young man now sir rowland de boys when he was alive
been a good friend to the banished duke so that frederick heard with regret whose son orlando was and would not befriend him but rosalind was delighted to hear that this handsome young stranger was the son of her father's old friend
as they were going away she turned back more than once to say another kind word to the brave young man gentleman she said giving him a chain from her neck wear this for me
could give more but that my hand lacks means rosalind and celia when they were alone began to talk about the handsome wrestler
celia wrestle with thy affections oh answered rosalind they take the part of a better wrestler than myself look here comes the duke with his eyes full of anger said celia
must leave the court at once he said to rosalind why she asked never mind why answered the duke you are banished if within ten days you are found within twenty miles of my court you die
rosalind set out to seek her father the banished duke in the forest of arden celia loved her too much to let her go alone and as it was rather a dangerous journey rosalind being the taller
up as a young countryman and her cousin as a country girl and rosalind said that she would be called ganymede and celia aliena they were very tired when at last they came to the forest of arden
as they were sitting on the grass a countryman passed that way and ganymede asked him if he could get them food he did so and told them that a shepherd's flocks and house were to be sold
bought these and settled down as shepherd and shepherdess in the forest in the meantime oliver having sought to take his brother orlando's life orlando also wandered into the forest
being kindly received stayed with him now orlando could think of nothing but rosalind and he went about the forest carving her name on trees and writing love sonnets and hanging them on the bushes and there rosalind and celia found them
day orlando met them but he did not know rosalind in her boy's clothes though he liked the pretty shepherd youth because he fancied a likeness in him to her he loved there is a foolish lover said rosalind
haunts these woods and hangs sonnets on the trees if i could find him i would soon cure him of his folly orlando confessed that he was the foolish lover
i will take her part and be wayward and contrary as is the way of women till i make you ashamed of your folly in loving her and so every day he went to her house and took a pleasure in saying to her all the pretty things he would have said to rosalind
she had the fine and secret joy of knowing that all his love words came to the right ears thus many days passed pleasantly away one morning as orlando was going to visit ganymede he saw a man asleep on the ground
that there was a lioness crouching near waiting for the man who was asleep to wake for they say that lions will not prey on anything that is dead or sleeping then orlando looked at the man and saw that it was his wicked brother oliver who had tried to take his life
fought with the lioness and killed her and saved his brother's life while orlando was fighting the lioness oliver woke to see his brother whom he had treated so badly saving him from a wild beast at the risk of his own life
made him repent of his wickedness and he begged orlando's pardon and from thenceforth they were dear brothers the lioness had wounded orlando's arm so much that he could not go on to see the shepherd
he sent his brother to ask ganymede to come to him oliver went and told the whole story to ganymede and aliena and aliena was so charmed with his manly way of confessing his faults that she fell in love with him at once
when ganymede heard of the danger orlando had been in she fainted and when she came to herself said truly enough i should have been a woman by right oliver went back to his brother and told him all this saying
love aliena so well that i will give up my estates to you and marry her and live here as a shepherd let your wedding be to morrow said orlando and i will ask the duke and his friends
how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes then answered rosalind still in ganymede's dress and speaking with his voic if you do love rosalind so near the heart then when your brother marries aliena
you marry her now the next day the duke and his followers and orlando and oliver and aliena were all gathered together for the wedding then ganymede came in and said to the duke
i bring in your daughter rosalind will you give her to orlando here that i would said the duke if i had all kingdoms to give with her and you say you will have her when i bring her
would i he answered were i king of all kingdoms then rosalind and celia went out and rosalind put on her pretty woman's clothes again and after a while came back she turned to her father
give myself to you for i am yours if there be truth in sight he said you are my daughter then she said to orlando i give myself to you for i am yours
there be truth in sight he said you are my rosalind i will have no father if you be not he she said to the duke and to orlando i will have no husband if you be not he
orlando and rosalind were married and oliver and celia and they lived happy ever after returning with the duke to the kingdom for frederick had been shown by a holy hermit the wickedness of his ways and so gave back the dukedom of his brother
himself went into a monastery to pray for forgiveness the wedding was a merry one in the mossy glades of the forest a shepherd and shepherdess who had been friends with rosalind when she was herself disguised as a shepherd were married on the same day
all with such pretty feastings and merrymakings as could be nowhere within four walls
he had not learned to read in his childhood
his father was called jean valjean or vlajean probably a sobriquet

i do from my heart answered jones of having debauched the girl but not from having gained her affections if i have said nightingale i am sorry for it
but time and absence will soon wear off such impressions it is a receipt i must take myself for to confess the truth to you i never liked any girl half so much in my whole life but i must let you into the whole secret tom
my father hath provided a match for me with a woman i never saw and she is now coming to town in order for me to make my addresses to her at these words jones burst into a loud fit of laughter
oh jones jones i wish i had a fortune in my own possession i heartily wish you had cries jones for if this be the case i sincerely pity you both but surely you don't intend to go away without taking your leave of her
i would not answered nightingale undergo the pain of taking leave for ten thousand pounds besides i am convinced instead of answering any good purpose it would only serve to inflame my poor nancy the more
and in the evening or to morrow morning i intend to depart jones promised he would not and said upon reflection he thought as he had determined and was obliged to leave her he took the most prudent method
he then told nightingale he should be very glad to lodge in the same house with him and it was accordingly agreed between them that nightingale should procure him either the ground floor
for the young gentleman himself was to occupy that which was between them this nightingale of whom we shall be presently obliged to say a little more was in the ordinary transactions of life a man of strict honour
and what is more rare among young gentlemen of the town one of strict honesty too yet in affairs of love he was somewhat loose in his morals not that he was even here as void of principle as gentlemen sometimes are
and oftener affect to be but it is certain he had been guilty of some indefensible treachery to women and had in a certain mystery called making love practised many deceits which if he had used in trade
but as the world i know not well for what reason agree to see this treachery in a better light he was so far from being ashamed of his iniquities of this kind that he gloried in them
and would often boast of his skill in gaining of women and his triumphs over their hearts for which he had before this time received some rebukes from jones who always exprest great bitterness against any misbehaviour to the fair part of the species
who if considered he said as they ought to be in the light of the dearest friends were to be cultivated honoured and caressed with the utmost love and tenderness but if regarded as enemies
than to value himself upon it chapter five a short account of the history of missus miller jones this day eat a pretty good dinner for a sick man
that is to say the larger half of a shoulder of mutton
for that good woman having learnt either by means of partridge or by some other means natural or supernatural that he had a connexion with mister allworthy could not endure the thoughts of parting with him in an angry manner jones accepted the invitation
and the girls sent out of the room than the widow without much preface began as follows well there are very surprizing things happen in this world but certainly it is a wonderful business that i should have a relation of mister allworthy in my house
alas sir you little imagine what a friend that best of gentlemen hath been to me and mine yes sir i am not ashamed to own it it is owing to his goodness that i did not long since perish for want and leave my poor little wretches two destitute
helpless friendless orphans to the care or rather to the cruelty of the world you must know sir though i am now reduced to get my living by letting lodgings i was born and bred a gentlewoman my father was an officer of the army
and died in a considerable rank but he lived up to his pay and as that expired with him his family at his death became beggars we were three sisters one of us had the good luck to die soon after of the small pox
and having inherited a vast fortune from her father which he had got by pawnbroking was married to a gentleman of great estate and fashion she used my sister so barbarously often upbraiding her with her birth and poverty
calling her in derision a gentlewoman that i believe she at length broke the heart of the poor girl in short she likewise died within a twelvemonth after my father fortune thought proper to provide better for me
and within a month from his decease i was married to a clergyman
charles a celebrated wrestler was there who had killed many men in contests of this kind orlando the young man he was to wrestle with was so slender and youthful that rosalind and celia thought he would surely be killed
as others had been so they spoke to him and asked him not to attempt so dangerous an adventure but the only effect of their words was to make him wish more to come off well in the encounter so as to win praise from such sweet ladies
orlando like rosalind's father was being kept out of his inheritance by his brother and was so sad at his brother's unkindness that
he did not care much whether he lived or died but now the sight of the fair rosalind gave him strength and courage so that he did marvelously and at last threw charles to such a tune that the wrestler had to be carried off the ground
duke frederick was pleased with his courage and asked his name my name is orlando and i am the youngest son of sir rowland de boys said the young man now sir rowland de boys when he was alive
had been a good friend to the banished duke so that frederick heard with regret whose son orlando was and would not befriend him but rosalind was delighted to hear that this handsome young stranger was the son of her father's old friend
and as they were going away she turned back more than once to say another kind word to the brave young man gentleman she said giving him a chain from her neck wear this for me
i could give more but that my hand lacks means rosalind and celia when they were alone began to talk about the handsome wrestler
said celia wrestle with thy affections oh answered rosalind they take the part of a better wrestler than myself look here comes the duke with his eyes full of anger said celia
you must leave the court at once he said to rosalind why she asked never mind why answered the duke you are banished if within ten days you are found within twenty miles of my court you die
so rosalind set out to seek her father the banished duke in the forest of arden celia loved her too much to let her go alone and as it was rather a dangerous journey rosalind being the taller
dressed up as a young countryman and her cousin as a country girl and rosalind said that she would be called ganymede and celia aliena they were very tired when at last they came to the forest of arden
and as they were sitting on the grass a countryman passed that way and ganymede asked him if he could get them food he did so and told them that a shepherd's flocks and house were to be sold
they bought these and settled down as shepherd and shepherdess in the forest in the meantime oliver having sought to take his brother orlando's life orlando also wandered into the forest
and being kindly received stayed with him now orlando could think of nothing but rosalind and he went about the forest carving her name on trees and writing love sonnets and hanging them on the bushes and there rosalind and celia found them
one day orlando met them but he did not know rosalind in her boy's clothes though he liked the pretty shepherd youth because he fancied a likeness in him to her he loved there is a foolish lover said rosalind
who haunts these woods and hangs sonnets on the trees if i could find him i would soon cure him of his folly orlando confessed that he was the foolish lover
and i will take her part and be wayward and contrary as is the way of women till i make you ashamed of your folly in loving her and so every day he went to her house and took a pleasure in saying to her all the pretty things he would have said to rosalind
and she had the fine and secret joy of knowing that all his love words came to the right ears thus many days passed pleasantly away one morning as orlando was going to visit ganymede he saw a man asleep on the ground
and that there was a lioness crouching near waiting for the man who was asleep to wake for they say that lions will not prey on anything that is dead or sleeping then orlando looked at the man and saw that it was his wicked brother oliver who had tried to take his life
he fought with the lioness and killed her and saved his brother's life while orlando was fighting the lioness oliver woke to see his brother whom he had treated so badly saving him from a wild beast at the risk of his own life
this made him repent of his wickedness and he begged orlando's pardon and from thenceforth they were dear brothers the lioness had wounded orlando's arm so much that he could not go on to see the shepherd
so he sent his brother to ask ganymede to come to him oliver went and told the whole story to ganymede and aliena and aliena was so charmed with his manly way of confessing his faults that she fell in love with him at once
but when ganymede heard of the danger orlando had been in she fainted and when she came to herself said truly enough i should have been a woman by right oliver went back to his brother and told him all this saying
i love aliena so well that i will give up my estates to you and marry her and live here as a shepherd let your wedding be to morrow said orlando and i will ask the duke and his friends
oh how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes then answered rosalind still in ganymede's dress and speaking with his voic if you do love rosalind so near the heart then when your brother marries aliena
shall you marry her now the next day the duke and his followers and orlando and oliver and aliena were all gathered together for the wedding then ganymede came in and said to the duke
if i bring in your daughter rosalind will you give her to orlando here that i would said the duke if i had all kingdoms to give with her and you say you will have her when i bring her
that would i he answered were i king of all kingdoms then rosalind and celia went out and rosalind put on her pretty woman's clothes again and after a while came back she turned to her father
i give myself to you for i am yours if there be truth in sight he said you are my daughter then she said to orlando i give myself to you for i am yours
if there be truth in sight he said you are my rosalind i will have no father if you be not he she said to the duke and to orlando i will have no husband if you be not he
so orlando and rosalind were married and oliver and celia and they lived happy ever after returning with the duke to the kingdom for frederick had been shown by a holy hermit the wickedness of his ways and so gave back the dukedom of his brother
and himself went into a monastery to pray for forgiveness the wedding was a merry one in the mossy glades of the forest a shepherd and shepherdess who had been friends with rosalind when she was herself disguised as a shepherd were married on the same day
and all with such pretty feastings and merrymakings as could be nowhere within four walls
