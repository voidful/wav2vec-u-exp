2042-136442-0029 HE THEN TOLD NIGHTINGALE HE SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO LODGE IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HIM AND IT WAS ACCORDINGLY AGREED BETWEEN THEM THAT NIGHTINGALE SHOULD PROCURE HIM EITHER THE GROUND FLOOR
2042-136442-0030 FOR THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN HIMSELF WAS TO OCCUPY THAT WHICH WAS BETWEEN THEM THIS NIGHTINGALE OF WHOM WE SHALL BE PRESENTLY OBLIGED TO SAY A LITTLE MORE WAS IN THE ORDINARY TRANSACTIONS OF LIFE A MAN OF STRICT HONOUR
2042-136442-0031 AND WHAT IS MORE RARE AMONG YOUNG GENTLEMEN OF THE TOWN ONE OF STRICT HONESTY TOO YET IN AFFAIRS OF LOVE HE WAS SOMEWHAT LOOSE IN HIS MORALS NOT THAT HE WAS EVEN HERE AS VOID OF PRINCIPLE AS GENTLEMEN SOMETIMES ARE
2042-136442-0032 AND OFTENER AFFECT TO BE BUT IT IS CERTAIN HE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF SOME INDEFENSIBLE TREACHERY TO WOMEN AND HAD IN A CERTAIN MYSTERY CALLED MAKING LOVE PRACTISED MANY DECEITS WHICH IF HE HAD USED IN TRADE
2042-136442-0033 BUT AS THE WORLD I KNOW NOT WELL FOR WHAT REASON AGREE TO SEE THIS TREACHERY IN A BETTER LIGHT HE WAS SO FAR FROM BEING ASHAMED OF HIS INIQUITIES OF THIS KIND THAT HE GLORIED IN THEM
2042-136442-0034 AND WOULD OFTEN BOAST OF HIS SKILL IN GAINING OF WOMEN AND HIS TRIUMPHS OVER THEIR HEARTS FOR WHICH HE HAD BEFORE THIS TIME RECEIVED SOME REBUKES FROM JONES WHO ALWAYS EXPREST GREAT BITTERNESS AGAINST ANY MISBEHAVIOUR TO THE FAIR PART OF THE SPECIES
2042-136442-0035 WHO IF CONSIDERED HE SAID AS THEY OUGHT TO BE IN THE LIGHT OF THE DEAREST FRIENDS WERE TO BE CULTIVATED HONOURED AND CARESSED WITH THE UTMOST LOVE AND TENDERNESS BUT IF REGARDED AS ENEMIES

2042-136442-0037 THAT IS TO SAY THE LARGER HALF OF A SHOULDER OF MUTTON
2042-136442-0038 FOR THAT GOOD WOMAN HAVING LEARNT EITHER BY MEANS OF PARTRIDGE OR BY SOME OTHER MEANS NATURAL OR SUPERNATURAL THAT HE HAD A CONNEXION WITH MISTER ALLWORTHY COULD NOT ENDURE THE THOUGHTS OF PARTING WITH HIM IN AN ANGRY MANNER JONES ACCEPTED THE INVITATION
2042-136442-0039 AND THE GIRLS SENT OUT OF THE ROOM THAN THE WIDOW WITHOUT MUCH PREFACE BEGAN AS FOLLOWS WELL THERE ARE VERY SURPRIZING THINGS HAPPEN IN THIS WORLD BUT CERTAINLY IT IS A WONDERFUL BUSINESS THAT I SHOULD HAVE A RELATION OF MISTER ALLWORTHY IN MY HOUSE
