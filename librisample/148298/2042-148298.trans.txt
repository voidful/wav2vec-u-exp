2042-148298-0001 AS OTHERS HAD BEEN SO THEY SPOKE TO HIM AND ASKED HIM NOT TO ATTEMPT SO DANGEROUS AN ADVENTURE BUT THE ONLY EFFECT OF THEIR WORDS WAS TO MAKE HIM WISH MORE TO COME OFF WELL IN THE ENCOUNTER SO AS TO WIN PRAISE FROM SUCH SWEET LADIES
2042-148298-0002 ORLANDO LIKE ROSALIND'S FATHER WAS BEING KEPT OUT OF HIS INHERITANCE BY HIS BROTHER AND WAS SO SAD AT HIS BROTHER'S UNKINDNESS THAT
2042-148298-0003 HE DID NOT CARE MUCH WHETHER HE LIVED OR DIED BUT NOW THE SIGHT OF THE FAIR ROSALIND GAVE HIM STRENGTH AND COURAGE SO THAT HE DID MARVELOUSLY AND AT LAST THREW CHARLES TO SUCH A TUNE THAT THE WRESTLER HAD TO BE CARRIED OFF THE GROUND
2042-148298-0004 DUKE FREDERICK WAS PLEASED WITH HIS COURAGE AND ASKED HIS NAME MY NAME IS ORLANDO AND I AM THE YOUNGEST SON OF SIR ROWLAND DE BOYS SAID THE YOUNG MAN NOW SIR ROWLAND DE BOYS WHEN HE WAS ALIVE
2042-148298-0005 HAD BEEN A GOOD FRIEND TO THE BANISHED DUKE SO THAT FREDERICK HEARD WITH REGRET WHOSE SON ORLANDO WAS AND WOULD NOT BEFRIEND HIM BUT ROSALIND WAS DELIGHTED TO HEAR THAT THIS HANDSOME YOUNG STRANGER WAS THE SON OF HER FATHER'S OLD FRIEND

2042-148298-0017 AND I WILL TAKE HER PART AND BE WAYWARD AND CONTRARY AS IS THE WAY OF WOMEN TILL I MAKE YOU ASHAMED OF YOUR FOLLY IN LOVING HER AND SO EVERY DAY HE WENT TO HER HOUSE AND TOOK A PLEASURE IN SAYING TO HER ALL THE PRETTY THINGS HE WOULD HAVE SAID TO ROSALIND
2042-148298-0018 AND SHE HAD THE FINE AND SECRET JOY OF KNOWING THAT ALL HIS LOVE WORDS CAME TO THE RIGHT EARS THUS MANY DAYS PASSED PLEASANTLY AWAY ONE MORNING AS ORLANDO WAS GOING TO VISIT GANYMEDE HE SAW A MAN ASLEEP ON THE GROUND
2042-148298-0019 AND THAT THERE WAS A LIONESS CROUCHING NEAR WAITING FOR THE MAN WHO WAS ASLEEP TO WAKE FOR THEY SAY THAT LIONS WILL NOT PREY ON ANYTHING THAT IS DEAD OR SLEEPING THEN ORLANDO LOOKED AT THE MAN AND SAW THAT IT WAS HIS WICKED BROTHER OLIVER WHO HAD TRIED TO TAKE HIS LIFE
